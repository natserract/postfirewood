# Redwood

**Redwood is an opinionated, full-stack, serverless-ready web application framework
that will allow you to build and deploy with ease.**
Imagine a React frontend, statically delivered by CDN, that talks via GraphQL to
your backend running on AWS Lambdas (or containers) around the world, all deployable with just a
`git push`â€”that's Redwood. By making a lot of decisions for you, Redwood lets
you get to work on what makes your application special, instead of wasting
cycles choosing and re-choosing various technologies and configurations. Plus,
because Redwood is a proper framework, you benefit from continued performance
and feature upgrades over time and with minimum effort.

> **NOTICE:** RedwoodJS is very close to a stable version 1.0. In the last two years,
> the project has matured significantly and is already used in production by a number
> of startups. We intend to have a 1.0 release candidate before the end of 2021 and
> to release a truly production-ready 1.0 in early 2022.

### Setup

We use Yarn as our package manager. To get the dependencies installed, just do this in the root directory:

```terminal
yarn install
```

### Fire it up

```terminal
yarn redwood dev
```

### Storybook

```terminal
yarn rw storybook
```

Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:8910` to see the web app. Lambda functions run on `http://localhost:8911` and are also proxied to `http://localhost:8910/.redwood/functions/*`.
